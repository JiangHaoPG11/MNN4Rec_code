# MNN4Rec_code
This code is used for MNN4Rec model and baselines models which are mentioned in the paper.
In this project, we try to construct multi-views news network and explore the relationship between news.
For the serious problem of news cold-starts, we aims to collaborate news, especially for the "cold news".
Besides, for the weak feedback of user click behaviors, we utilize multi-head self-attention layer to filter noisy and explore interaction among user clicked news, aiming to improve user interest explainability.
